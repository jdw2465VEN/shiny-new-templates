# shiny-new-templates
**INSTRUCTIONS for using this template:** When creating a new VENtegration, start with this template. It contains the basic components we'd discussed for creating a best practice, customer-friendly GitHub repo for adopting and using Venafi integrations with third party solutions. The intent is to both save time for authors and testers as you develop and contribute new integrations. We'll continue to refine and improve this template over time. If you have suggestions for making it better, please reach out to the UA team.
